* ox-w3ctr --- org export backend for W3C TR CSS style

Based on Org-mode's ox-html.el and CSS of W3C Technical Report [[https://github.com/w3c/tr-design][tr-design]]'s base.css.

** Status

| Emacs Version   | 30.1         |  31.1 |  32.1 |  33.1 |  34.1 |  35.1 |  36.1 | 37.1    | ... |
|-----------------+--------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+---------+-----|
| Package Version | 0.2~0.3      | 0.4.x | 0.5.x | 0.6.x | 0.7.x | 0.8.x | 0.9.x | 1.0 !!! |     |
| Date            | [2025-02-23] |  2027 |  2029 |  2031 |  2033 |  2035 |  2037 | 2038?   |     |

The current ox-w3ctr has not yet completed a full refactoring of the
ox-html code, though itâ€™s already largely usable. I plan to release
version 0.4 when Emacs 31.1 comes out, and then increment the version by
0.1 with each major Emacs release until reaching the official 1.0 at
Emacs :p

When version 0.4 is released, the package should no longer introduce
breaking changes, and Emacs 31.1 will be the minimum supported
version. In a sense, 0.4 will be the first official release. If more
users and bug reports come in, this process from 0.4 to 1.0 might move
faster.

** Install and Use

Please use Emacs 30.1.50 or above. Download this repo and add it to
=load-path=, or use =package-vc= like this:

#+begin_src text
M-x package-vs-install https://github.com/include-yy/ox-w3ctr RET
#+end_src

After installation and load, use =C-c C-e w o= to export a org buffer to
HTML file. See more information from docstrings and comments (at least
now).

** TODO list [0/3]

1. [ ] Totally Refactor from ox-html.
2. [ ] Fully detailed documentation.
3. [ ] A friendly introductive video.
4. [ ] CI/CD support.
